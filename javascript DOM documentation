#place src just at the bottom of the body
main stuff - document
the stuff inside body and head children 
for getting more stuffs use a dot operator .
lastElementChild - this gives the last child
has 2 stuffs properties and methods
method
.click()
.appendChild()
properties -
.innerHTML
.document 


firstElementChild - this gives the first child tag in the html 
document.querySelector("ul") - helps in quicker finding of tags
change.innerHTML - Helps in modifying the text content in side the tag
document.getElementsByTagName - this helps in selecting stuffs all under a tagname
style.color - gives color
getElementbyTagName("li") - for getting stuffs from tagName .... choose the items [] to modify it...  .length for getting
uses hierarchical selector
for css it should be camel cased no dash ano;l
value should be represented as string
getElementsByClassName - by class name say like button anol
getElementById - by ID since we have one id its singular
querySelector() - This helps in finding all sorts of elements
querySelector('li a') - make sure they are hierarchical
document.querySelectorAll - finding all sorts of stuffs with same , ID and class
document.querySelector("button").classList.add/remove/toggle("invisible"); = this helps in changing those attributes 
we can add class by again mentioning in css
textcontent - doesn't shows all the stuffs inside tag
attributes - for all attributes 
set attributes / get - for getting and setting make sure we use diff parametres
eventListener - it listen when something is done say clicking anol also has 2 parametres
     1) type say what will it listern like mouse click 
     2) it say what to be done like handle cllick
when evr parenthesis is added it shows of immediately this is called as straight away listener...handleClick()
document.querySelector("button").classlist;
.invincible{
visibility : "Hidden"
} for removingstuffs
.attributes to remove to get all attributess

##higher order functions
use $0 for grabbing the text u need change using console
     $0.addevenListener("click",function() {
      console.log("I got clicked")
      }));
      this code shows tht I got clicked when ever I click it
for calculating instead of such a tedious process
     function calculator(num1,num2,ooperator) {
     return operator(num1,num2)
     }
debugger -
          This helps in debugging stuffs just type debugger in console
the functions tht take up other is called as higher order


##how to add sounds
var audio = new Audio("filename.mp3")
audio.play()
   this helps in triggering 
   this.set.color=("white")helps in changing color


java script - objects
creating an object
    var houseKeeper1 {
    name :"shaam";
    age : 19
    work : ["money","room"]
    }
    
 create a factory to manage lots of data
 no camelcasing
 function BellBoy (name,age,work,language){
 this:name=name
 .
 .
 } so on like it has features in it
 then in console
 var houseKeeper1 = new(this is important)HouseKeeper("shaam",19)
 change this no need to do from first
 

switch -
    takes the variable based on the switch not like if else
var buttonInnerHTML = this.innerHTML
switch(buttonInnerHTML){
case "w":
var audio = new Audio("filename.mp3")
audio.play()
break:
default: like else statement
}

move suitcase dot notation
function BellBoy (name,age,work,language){
 this:name=name
 this.movesuitcase = function(){
 alert("can I take the suitcase")
 pickupsuitcase();
 move();
 }
 in console
 var hk1 = new hk("jame",12,['bed'])
 hk1.clean()
 this gives an output called clean
 
 
##keyboard event listener
document.addeventListener("keypress",function(){  document is added so it detects entirely
alert('key was pressed')
})
paste the switch statement iinside this so tht even sound is produced

#callback function
    the function tht is passed in as a input
 document.addEventListener("keypress", respondToKey(event))
 function respondToKey(event){
 console.log('key is pressed')}

call back helps to determine what function triggered tht evnt
function anotherEventListener(typeofevent, callback)

var eventththappend = {
eventType = "keypressed"
button = "p"
}
if (eventThtHappend === typeofevent){
callback(eventThtHappend)
}

#button animation
buttonAnimation(buttonInnerHTML) place this along with keys
function buttonAnimation(currentKey){
var activeButton = document.queryselector("."+currentKey)
activeButton.classList.add("Pressed")
time out function to get back the animation
setTimeOut(myFunction(){
activeButton.classList.remove("pressed");
},100)
}
