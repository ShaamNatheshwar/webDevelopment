these play an important role
they can be either mentioned in pixels or in percentage to takee out stuffs
if we use solid it shows up 3 pixels solid border
border - this is boundary
width gives u additional increase in size say if we have border width - 50 px we have additional width
we can specify wat we want say by mentioning border top so on
or if we are lazy we use circularing 0px 0px 0px 0px which forms in a clockwise direction

padding - btw margin and content
say ifwe want space bw content and margin we will go for padding 
padding : 20px;

margin - outside the border separating between different stuffs
margin:10px;
