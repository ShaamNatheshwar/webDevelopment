Static - 
   go along with html rules keep its flow default
Relative - 
   say if we give left L : 30px it moves towards right...its like ghost it will posses on other lol

Absolute -
    we are postioning relative to its parent right:30px it moves r8
    affects the position
    when u give it a parent say a container it then acts accordingly say position is relative it does relative stuffs
Fixed - 
   despite of scrolling it will be stay as it is
