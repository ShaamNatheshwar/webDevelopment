css has 4 display property
block - 
  takes the whole width of the display doesn't allow other to form
     p , li , h1-h6 , 
  div , forms  width can be changed
  use span inorder to edit internally
inline block - 
    as the name suggest it overcomes the difficulties faced by both inline and block
    we can change width using this 
inline -
    takes space as much as they needed not like block 
    width doesn't change 
       span img anchor
     
none -
    helps in removing the element
    visibility holds the place but disappears
